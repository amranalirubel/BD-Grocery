# BD-Grocery

Online Grocery Shopping is an eCommerce based web application for our Web Programming project.
I have developed a sample in which user can search and find necessary information about any grocery item,
can proceed to checkout to buy products.
User can create an account, update personal information, can check its past activities, orders and transactions, and cart items.

Designed and developed a grocery store website with the following criteria:

- Users to browse products organized by aisles
- Users can add different products to their cart
- Users can create an account and log in to make their purchase
- Customer, product, and order data must be held in a database
- Admin must be able to edit customer, product, and order data in the back store
